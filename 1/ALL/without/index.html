                  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/651905/">first article</a>,
                  some interesting tools have appeared to demonstrate the
                  digital storage atypical capabilities of Youtube. For example,
                  <a
                    href="https://github.com/DvorakDwarf/Infinite-Storage-Glitch"
                    >Infinite-Storage-Glitch</a
                  >
                  utility. The author of this utility, taking advantage of the
                  reasonable placement of digital information in black and white
                  <a
                    href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27183946/what-does-cv-8uc3-and-the-other-types-stand-for-in-opencv"
                    >CV_8UC3</a
                  >
                  format, successfully used Youtube, if not as a fully fledged
                  Dropbox, then as a prototype of an alternative file storage,
                  which led to a lot of different inspirations and generated a
                  lot of angry reactions from users, including ethical ones.
                  <br /><br />
                  Perhaps the next quite obvious step in the evolution of the
                  tool would have been to replace the
                  <s>boring wallpaper</s> flickering black and white squares,
                  creating only visual discomfort for the viewer, with full
                  colour video with sound. However, what prevented the author
                  from taking this quite expected step? Probably the fact that
                  colour video requires a different paradigmatic approach. It is
                  one thing to be able to record and read digital information
                  virtually losslessly, and quite another to have to deal with
                  an optimising video codec. However, it must be acknowledged
                  that work in colour is still being done and there are some
                  fruitful attempts in this direction [<a
                    href="https://github.com/pixelomer/bin2video"
                    >1</a
                  >]. <br /><br />
                  By <s>popular demand</s> of habr-users (one person asked for
                  it in the comments), I decided to continue my own experiments
                  and develop the software solution as a separate utility. This
                  imposed on previous desire to implement in one evening, now in
                  Go, without using any external steganographic libraries and
                  other special tools, an experimental software utility, which
                  searches the depth of steganographic capabilities of video
                  hosting. <br /><br />
                  It should be emphasized that the nature of the author's
                  interest in the topic in question is rooted not in a desire to
                  misuse Youtube, which would have been, at the very least, of
                  dubious ethical nature, but in new opportunities opening up
                  extremely widely at the intersection of software engineering
                  craft and sporting excitement. It was interesting to work in a
                  situation where the loss of information is an intractable
                  "ontological" condition in the work of steganography. This is
                  where the focus of research interest shone with all its
                  colours. Because it is quite boring to steganograph a file,
                  provided it is not purposefully modified, tested by Youtube's
                  de-masking techniques, but used only as it was prepared.
                  <br /><br />
                  For science-based experiments Youtube is a very good place to
                  experiment, as it represents the state-of-the-art and most
                  advanced system for optimising video streams on an industrial
                  scale and can very "intelligently" resist the urge to do
                  anything with the video data beyond its primary use scenario.
                  For example, Youtube has a multi-level validation and
                  optimization strategy, delayed in time, and can optimize an
                  uploaded file not immediately but in steps, using different
                  techniques to do so.
                  <br /><br />
                  Thus, Youtube exploits the psychovisual redundancy factor to
                  the limit. This factor is brought to the point where the
                  indistinguishability (weak distinguishability) of details in
                  images to the human eye allows optimization as far as the
                  packaging algorithms proposed by engineers and the
                  predetermined balance between the quality and size of video
                  data storage allow.
                  <br /><br />
                  Therefore, the first thing to be fiercely resisted from the
                  very first steps of the experiment is the codec's desire to
                  get rid of small details that do not noticeably affect video
                  quality for humans, but affect the completeness and integrity
                  of steganography in principle. Video optimization doesn't
                  allow using such well-known and available in steganography
                  methods as, for example,
                  <a
                    href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/what-is-least-significant-bit-algorithm-in-information-security"
                    >Least Significant Bit insertion</a
                  >, because codecs radically "grind" colours in the image by
                  restructuring originally formed video containers. The metadata
                  that is transmitted with the video file is removed. These
                  kinds of steganographic tools prove to be "fragile" or
                  "semi-fragile" as they are fully or partially destroyed when
                  the codecs work. Youtube algorithms inevitably lead to loss of
                  integrity and completeness in the stored data when it comes to
                  our technique of "pixel burn-in" in a colour image. It is
                  almost impossible to store data efficiently in noise as well,
                  since noise and fine textures, as already mentioned, are
                  optimised in the first place. <br /><br />
                  Further, which caused the author of the article even more
                  creative excitement and trepidation, the research programmer
                  easily gets caught in the vicious circle of his engineering
                  stereotypes. His quite reasonable and justified desire for
                  reliable information storage leads to the need for multiple
                  redundancy of containers. And the multiple redundancy
                  situation creates new opportunities for data compression. This
                  occurs when one portion of data is similar to another portion
                  of data, as the total pool of images increases and new levels
                  of storage and video optimisation are available.
                  <br /><br />
                  All the above has allowed the author to maintain a high degree
                  of research interest throughout the duration of the
                  experiments and to actively search for various robust
                  approaches to data storage and retrieval and to coding under
                  the conditions of providing the requirements for noise
                  immunity.
                  <br /><br />
                  <h6>Ethical aspect</h6>
                  Although the topic has already been raised once, we believe it
                  is worth reiterating in this new context that steganography
                  implies working with certain information in the context of
                  keeping the very fact of such information secret. Our
                  situation is somewhat different. For research purposes, we do
                  not conceal our intentions, we declare it openly by adding
                  explanations and by placing links to the materials we use,
                  consistent with the free and fair use of software engineering
                  tools and technologies and all the products generated by them.
                  All our results are open and available for reproduction, study
                  and evaluation. Steganography artefacts are also not closed,
                  but openly fractured. We do not mislead anyone and we respect
                  the rights of copyright holders. Moreover, we encourage
                  everyone who happens to be involved in our work to do the
                  same. This work consisted of determining the depth of
                  capability of the proposed tool to ensure the sustainability

                  <h6>Utility description</h6>
                  The utility of the author of this article implements coding by
                  placing in a sequence of PNG frames, into which the background
                  video is split, conditionally hidden data by making
                  insignificant changes in the images. The degree of
                  "insignificance" is subjective. This degree can be adjusted,
                  for example, by adjusting the coefficient of visual
                  satisfaction, on the one hand, and also determined by the
                  control of data recovery errors, on the other hand.
                  <br /><br />
                  The following steps can be distinguished in the utility's work
                  cycle:
                  <br /><br />
                  1) Providing the necessary redundancy in the input bitstream.
                  The experiment uses a naive approach that implements
                  sequential data redundancy at a certain frequency. The
                  interpretation of input and output streams as bit channels, in
                  our opinion, successfully fits into Go's unbuffered channel
                  type representation. We emphasize here that Go was chosen
                  because its concepts are well suited to stream processing and
                  it has built-in mechanisms to ensure and control its
                  performance.
                  <br /><br />
                  2) Implementation of data homogeneity to ensure resistance to
                  write corruption by mixing bytes (and, as an experimental
                  tool, bits in bytes). Here it is a question of implementing
                  the data whitening process — changing the byte sequence (and
                  bits per byte as a separate option) to flatten the data
                  distribution and remove any unwanted patterns or
                  autocorrelations in it, primarily so that Youtube can select
                  as few targets as possible for forced optimization based on
                  examination of statistical properties in the data of the file
                  taken for video-hosting.
                  <br /><br />
                  3) At the stage of homogeneity criterion realization Stegokey
                  — key is used as the lowest level algorithm in steganographic
                  persistence provision, which allows to place and then restore
                  source data over the decoded array of bytes (including
                  individual bits).
                  <br /><br />
                  4) Preparing to store binary information in the body of the
                  background video file by "burning" individual pixels according
                  to overlapping patterns. By and large, this method is
                  equivalent to watermarking an image. It involves blending two
                  images (a background image and one specially prepared to store
                  binary information). An important goal is to find a balance
                  between the quality of the blending and the guarantee of
                  recoverability of the information. To achieve this, the tool
                  uses three levels — "aggressive" level for video hosting
                  Youtube, "experimental" level for ongoing experiments in
                  finding the balance of parameters and "comfortable" level for
                  simple steganography, but fragile to damage containers.
                  <br /><br />
                  Two 8x8 pixel zebra patterns are chosen as the patterns for
                  storing bits of information in the image. The size is chosen
                  empirically. These patterns are the simplest variation on the
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcode">Barcode</a>
                  and

                  One zebra is rotated 90° in relation to the other. This type
                  of pattern has many practical advantages, such as the easy
                  implementation of optical classification of the two classes
                  and the high reliability of separation in demarcation under
                  noisy conditions, which is achieved by contrasting pattern
                  structures and redundancy.
                  <br /><br />
                  The next step is to unroll the "carpet" of such patterns
                  according to the encoding bitstream — sequentially covering
                  frame by frame. The remaining volume of the last frame, in
                  order to mask the exact size of the donor file, is filled with
                  rubbish.
                  <br /><br />
                  Decoding performs the reverse operation — collapsing the
                  "carpet". This is implemented through pattern recognition in
                  the sequence of frames pulled from the video. At first we will
                  downloaded from Youtube video and "chewed" it up with
                  optimization algorithms and cut it into frames as before and
                  run the above mentioned operation for each frame.
                  <br /><br />
                  It should be emphasized that in the quest to counter Youtube's
                  success in optimizing videos, in a situation where the human
                  eye can barely see the difference between frames, it is
                  inevitable that with the addition of our artifacts, human
                  vision will still feel the difference. So how can we help
                  mitigate the effects of such distortion on picture clarity?
                  The easiest method to get rid of this flaw, in our opinion,
                  would be to encode at a higher resolution and have the user
                  view the video below it at one level. For example, preparing
                  video in hd1080 resolution, and viewing hd720, etc.
                  <br /><br />
                  <h6>Experiment</h6>
                  Let's carry out a simple experiment to estimate visual quality
                  of the result of mixing in WEBM hd1080 video acceptor of the
                  donor file. As a donor was used Pushkin's novel "Dubrovsky".
                  The parameters were chosen in such a way that the amount of
                  information to be mixed was within the relatively acceptable
                  waiting time of the utility.

                  methods of "burning" pixels are weakly ineffective, since they
                  do not completely remove the problem of flickering and
                  actualize a new problem of loss of color saturation of the
                  image. However, the "fragile" version of steganography looks
                  almost without flaws.
                  <br /><br />
                  <h6>ToDoList</h6>
                  1. Algorithms for effective error correction are not
                  implemented in the body of the utility, but they can be easily
                  connected via pipe or placed in a separate wrapper utility.
                  However, in order to optimize the entire steganography
                  circuit, it is desirable to include them in the core of the
                  utility with options for making targeted optimization
                  decisions.
                  <br /><br />
                  2. Unfortunately, the result of the steganography of this
                  utility does not have cryptographic strength. However, this
                  was not in the original plans. However, as in the previous
                  case, the initial wrapping of the file in a cryptographic
                  "bag" with error correction removes this task from the agenda
                  for now.
                  <br /><br />
                  3. Algorithmic optimization of algorithms in the Go language
                  is still waiting for its finest hour. Now the steganographic
                  procedure requires significant computational costs. The Go
                  language provides a lot of convenience for refactoring code to
                  the form when the utility can demonstrate its best sides in
                  this aspect.
                  <br /><br />
                  4. A more fine-tuning of ffmpeg parameters is required when
                  assembling the result file from separate frames, since at the
                  moment there are certain problems with video and audio out of
                  sync. In addition, it is easy to notice that the speed of the
                  utility depends on the performance of this library with PNG
                  files.
                  <br /><br />
                  5. It would be nice to dissolve meta-information about data in
                  stored containers, including the size, file name, and
                  checksum, write it into the body of the binary result,
                  "smearing" it over the entire length of the file with an "even
                  layer" and turn the storage into a kind of digital fractal
                  form, when aggressive cutting of an arbitrary part of it
                  entirely or by individual bits up to a certain threshold of
                  sensitivity, ensuring integrity and completeness, would not
                  lead to fatal quality losses. However, this task can also be
                  technically reduced to the actions set out in paragraphs 1 or
                  2 of this list.
                  <br /><br />
                  <h6>Conclusions</h6>
                  1. It turned out that in practice it is quite possible to
                  "dissolve" any binary file by placing it in the body of the
                  video file so that at the same time the embedded data can be
                  relatively easily and unhindered to get back later with a
                  certain guarantee.
                  <br /><br />
                  2. Our own steganographic pet craft was able to withstand the
                  basic tests and successfully pass through all the
                  <s>circles of hell</s> millstone of internal verifications and
                  transformations of Youtube. However, at the same time, the
                  reader's attention should be focused on the fact that the
                  utility currently does not meet the requirements of
                  steganographic stability and is therefore open for completion
                  in
                  <a href="https://github.com/aleksiej-ostrowski/stegano2"
                    >open source</a
                  >
                  mode, in the hope of evolution. <br /><br />
                  3. According to the results of experiments, the utility
                  received a kind of counter-motto: long, expensive,
                  inefficient. Therefore, the created tool cannot be used by
                  anyone to cause any harm or significant damage to video
                  hosting sites by turning them into analogues of a dropbox.
                  Speaking more specifically, bitwise data processing and
                  pixel-by-pixel image processing in a computational sense are
                  not acceptable for industrial operation of the method as a
                  kind of competitive alternative to file storage.
                  <br /><br />
                  4. The implemented task opens up an even wider space for
                  further experiments, since it allows and even targets a wide
                  range of readers for a creative search of algorithms,
                  processing parameters, storage, and display of video
                  information. We hope that the combination of various
                  algorithmic techniques, including those well described in the
                  literature, will allow us to achieve more noticeable results
                  in this area.

                  working demonstration of the experiment. Bitmap processing is
                  obviously not a good idea and so the optimization of the
                  working stack is still waiting to be done. First of all,
                  attention should be paid to the proper utilization of the CPU.

                    I wanted to install linux on my acer laptop. But my laptop
                    has BIOS version 1.03. In
                    <a
                      href="https://www.acer.com/ac/pl/PL/content/support-product/9334?b=1"

                    I saw that the latest version is 1.07. There is a Windows
                    executable file only. Looking ahead: I tried to use
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine_(software)"
                      >wine</a
                    >
                    in Ubuntu to run this file. But it failed. Firstly, I had to
                    install Windows. But which USB boot solution is chosen? On
                    the advice of my friend, I have chosen
                    <a href="https://github.com/ventoy/Ventoy/releases"
                      >Ventoy</a
                    >. As it turned out, the BIOS firmware should reboot in DOS
                    mode without the Windows environment. It was funny. After
                    Ventoy prepared the flash card on Ubuntu, it looked as
                    empty, but it was bootable. I saved the ISO Windows and
                    Linux files for the installations to the flash drive through
                    a simple copy operation. After these manipulations, I
                    started experimenting. I downloaded the new versions of
                    Endless OS, Linux Mint, Ubuntu and Manjaro. I read that
                    someone sells a laptop like mine with Endless OS. Therefore,
                    I hoped to install this operating system successfully. But
                    it failed. This OS is not even started. Then I successfully
                    started Manjaro. I really like this OS. This operating
                    system is very ergonomic and functional. But I saw it not
                    worked with my Wi-Fi device. I connected to LAN and did not
                    see the problem in time. There are many options for choosing
                    a Linux kernel in Manjaro. I have chosen version 6.0.0, but
                    Wi-Fi didn't work yet. Linux Mint has the similar problem.
                    Besides, the web camera didn't work either. I decided to
                    stop on Ubuntu. Because, the Wi-Fi worked well. <br /><br />
